# Risk Assessment & Mitigation

**Risk Rating**

To determine the overall damage to the project that a risk may have, we applied the likelihood and impact of the risks via a risk matrix to abstract a ‘risk rating’, ranking them from Low, Medium, High and Critical:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
Likelihood</td>
    <td>Impact</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>

    <td>Negligible</td>
    <td>Minor</td>
    <td>Moderate</td>
    <td>Major</td>
    <td>Severe</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Very Likely</td>
    <td>Medium</td>
    <td>Medium</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td>Low</td>

  </tr>
</table>


**Impact Definitions**

* Negligible - The impact of the risk will only delay the project by a small number of hours

* Minor - The impact of the risk will delay the project by 1-2 days

* Moderate - The impact of the risk will delay the project by 3-5 days

* Major - The impact of the risk will delay the project by 1-2 weeks

* Severe - The impact of the risk will delay the project by 2 or more weeks

**Likelihood definitions**

* Very Likely - Occurs once a week

* Likely - Occurs once in two weeks

* Somewhat Likely - Occurs once in three weeks

* Unlikely - Occurs once a month

* Very Unlikely - May occur once during the project completion time

**Risk format justification**

The risks have been formatted into a table consisting of 3 columns; Risk name and description, Mitigation, and Overall Risk. The rows are sorted into descending order of overall risk rating so risks that would have the biggest impact are clearly visible and distinguishable. Risks are ranked by evaluating negative impact to project and likelihood of possibility.  Table suggest mitigation strategy, that would help effectively solve potential problems.

    <td>Mitigation</td>
    <td>Overall Risk</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Ineffective communication between group members</td>
    <td>GitHub and Slack allows effective communicate between group members. Failure to communicate will have a reason. Schedule a special meeting with an elected mediator to allow poor communicators to explain their issue(s) and re-integrate with the team.</td>
    <td>Somewhat Likely/Severe </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Project team misunderstood requirements</td>
    <td>Following Scrum methodology frequent team meetings are held and requirements are often reviewed. Team maintains consistent communication via Slack and through face-to-face means.</td>
    <td>Somewhat Likely/Severe</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Team members missing
important team meetings</td>
    <td>Communicating via Slack, ZenHub. Team member is provided with all necessary information that he missed. If that person is still missing team meetings, problem will be reported to lecturers.</td>
    <td>Likely/Major</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Inadequate architecture, performance and quality </td>
    <td>Simulation created and benchmarking results are evaluated. Prototype is created to allow tuning of some required details.</td>
    <td>Unlikely/Severe</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Deletion of project code</td>
    <td>GitHub minimises the likelihood of complete loss of code, regular backup via forking to personal repositories increases redundancy and cloning of the repository to an offline location before major changes further reduces risk.</td>
    <td>Very Unlikely/Severe</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Final build has low quality</td>
    <td>Prototype developed to test functionality. Disciplined development process is used. Technical reviews are used on all requirements, designs, and code.
Test planning assures all functionality will be covered by system testing. System tests are performed by independent testers.</td>
    <td>Unlikely/Severe
Impact</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Poor project planning </td>
    <td>Gantt charts alongside our agile development model (Organised by ZenHub for GitHub) allow us to establish a clear overview of bottlenecks in the project and then refactor the plan as we go.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Certain team members lack of specialized skill required by the project </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Poor productivity</td>
    <td>ZenHub for GitHub is used. It shows visual display of effort that people put in. It indicates team members that don’t contribute enough. Therefore it allows to locate and solve an issue fast.</td>
    <td>Somewhat Likely/Moderate </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Member of team is sick and can’t participate in further work</td>
    <td>Program code is submitted in GitHub therefore the rest of a the team can continue working. No member will ever have a 100% share in a mission critical task. Frequent commits and clear comments will allow members to compensate for illness or absence.</td>

    <td>Somewhat Likely/Moderate</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Overriding each other’s work</td>
    <td>Over-writing other’s work should only occur after proper code review enforced by the pull request system. This review process allows us to ensure any changes removing or changing others’ work to be intended and functional.</td>
    <td>Unlikely/Major</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Internet access is compromised for a prolonged period of time</td>
    <td>Whenever a pull request is approved, all team members should back the repository’s master branch up so that they can work on the game without requiring internet access. 4G data-plans can be activated if necessary to acquire internet connections.</td>
