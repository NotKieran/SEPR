#Requirements

##Requirements Elicitation Procedure

To determine the requirements for our system we conducted two interviews with our major stakeholders, they went as follows:

Stakeholder Interview 1**:**

This interview was an initial discussion with our stakeholders to clarify points from the brief and to present our ideas from the initial brainstorm. The transcript can be found at **[1]**. Following this interview we elicited some key requirements and constructed two paper prototypes to quiz our stakeholders on features we were unsure of.

Stakeholder Interview 2:

This interview involved our demo-ing of a hotseat UI and a side by side UI to determine which method of multiplayer was prefered. The prototypes allowed us to adapt the UI on the fly and come up with a design solution that suited the stakeholders and audience

Alongside our stakeholder interviews we conducted research into resource management games **[7]** to feed into our ideas for UI and the game experience and mechanics overall. Focussing on determining a list of positive and negative points for each game we refined what features are enjoyed by the community and what features and factors make games less enjoyable to play. We also conducted a questionnaire **[4]** to communicate with our audience and get a feel for their experience of videogames and resource management games. Finally we did brief research into the law of supply and the law of demand **[5,6] **to allow the market to represent a real world market in a basic way.

##Presentation of Requirements

The main requirements have been listed in bold and numbered. Each main requirement has sub-requirements which provide finer details and justifications for that requirement. Any Numbers in **[ ]** at the end of a justification for a requirement refer to the bibliography. 

Research was carried out to determine how our requirements should be presented. The format is loosely based on the IEEE standard **[8]**. Originally we adopted a tabular format for the requirements, this was later replaced due to the amount of space that the structure of the format needed. The list format is more appropriate with our space constraints but still allows for a convenient numbering system.

Each requirements’ associated risks were also discussed and considered thoroughly: these risks, along with alternative requirements that can be implemented should they present issues, are described on the project’s website and can be accessed through the site’s contents’ page.
