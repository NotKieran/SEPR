  <p># <strong>Requirements</strong></p>
<p>## <strong>Requirements Elicitation Procedure</strong></p>
<p>To determine the requirements for our system we conducted two interviews with our major stakeholders, they went as follows:</p>
<p>Stakeholder Interview 1**:**</p>
<p>This interview was an initial discussion with our stakeholders to clarify points from the brief and to present our ideas from the initial brainstorm. The transcript can be found at <strong>[1]</strong>. Following this interview we elicited some key requirements and constructed two paper prototypes to quiz our stakeholders on features we were unsure of.</p>
<p>Stakeholder Interview 2:</p>
<p>This interview involved our demo-ing of a hotseat UI and a side by side UI to determine which method of multiplayer was prefered. The prototypes allowed us to adapt the UI on the fly and come up with a design solution that suited the stakeholders and audience</p>
<p>Alongside our stakeholder interviews we conducted research into resource management games <strong>[7]</strong> to feed into our ideas for UI and the game experience and mechanics overall. Focussing on determining a list of positive and negative points for each game we refined what features are enjoyed by the community and what features and factors make games less enjoyable to play. We also conducted a questionnaire <strong>[4]</strong> to communicate with our audience and get a feel for their experience of videogames and resource management games. Finally we did brief research into the law of supply and the law of demand to allow the market to represent a real world market in a basic way.</p>
<p>## <strong>Presentation of Requirements</strong></p>
<p>The main requirements have been listed in bold and numbered. Each main requirement has sub-requirements which provide finer details and justifications for that requirement. Any Numbers in <strong>[ ]</strong> at the end of a justification for a requirement refer to the bibliography.</p>
<p>Research was carried out to determine how our requirements should be presented. The format is loosely based on the IEEE standard <strong>[8]</strong>. Originally we adopted a tabular format for the requirements, this was later replaced due to the amount of space that the structure of the format needed. The list format is more appropriate with our space constraints but still allows for a convenient numbering system.</p>
<p>## <strong>User Requirements</strong></p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>The player will interface with the game via the use of a mouse and keyboard</strong><ol class="arabic" start="36">

<li><em>The type of tile that it is; The type of resources that can be gained from it; what kind of Roboticon is working on it (if one’s working on the tile at all); options to assign or withdraw Roboticons from each tile and an option to upgrade the Roboticon working on the tile</em></li>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Each tile should be visually distinguishable and follow a consistent art-style</strong></li>

</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>The game needs to be playable on university computers</strong><ol class="arabic" start="44">
<li>It should not require a dedicated graphics accelerator other than those included with the processors powering the university’s PCs</li>
<li>It should not consume more than 4GB of RAM under any circumstances</li>
<li>The combined file-size of the game and all of its resources should be small enough to fit on the university’s servers comfortably</li>
<li>Windows 10 should be supported as these are the operating systems that the university computers run</li>
<li>It should not exceed a resolution of [1680 × 1050], as this is the resolution at which the monitors in the university’s CS department operate</li>
