<span id="requirements-elicitation-procedure"></span><h1><strong>Requirements Elicitation Procedure</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#requirements-elicitation-procedure" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>To determine the requirements for our system we conducted two interviews with our major stakeholders, they went as follows:</p>
<p>Stakeholder Interview 1<strong>:</strong></p>
<p>This interview was an initial discussion with our stakeholders to clarify points from the brief and to present our ideas from the initial brainstorm. The transcript can be found at <strong>[1]</strong>. Following this interview we elicited some key requirements and constructed two paper prototypes to quiz our stakeholders on features we were unsure of.</p>
<p>Stakeholder Interview 2:</p>
<p>This interview involved our demo-ing of a hotseat UI and a side by side UI to determine which method of multiplayer was prefered. The prototypes allowed us to adapt the UI on the fly and come up with a design solution that suited the stakeholders and audience</p>
<p>Alongside our stakeholder interviews we conducted research into resource management games <strong>[7]</strong> to feed into our ideas for UI and the game experience and mechanics overall. Focussing on determining a list of positive and negative points for each game we refined what features are enjoyed by the community and what features and factors make games less enjoyable to play. We also conducted a questionnaire <strong>[4]</strong> to communicate with our audience and get a feel for their experience of videogames and resource management games. Finally we did brief research into the law of supply and the law of demand **[5,6] **to allow the market to represent a real world market in a basic way.</p>

<span id="presentation-of-requirements"></span><h1><strong>Presentation of Requirements</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#presentation-of-requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The main requirements have been listed in bold and numbered. Each main requirement has sub-requirements which provide finer details and justifications for that requirement. Any Numbers in <strong>[ ]</strong> at the end of a justification for a requirement refer to the bibliography.</p>
<p>Research was carried out to determine how our requirements should be presented. The format is loosely based on the IEEE standard <strong>[8]</strong>. Originally we adopted a tabular format for the requirements, this was later replaced due to the amount of space that the structure of the format needed. The list format is more appropriate with our space constraints but still allows for a convenient numbering system.</p>
<p>Each requirements’ associated risks were also discussed and considered thoroughly: these risks, along with alternative requirements that can be implemented should they present issues, are described on the project’s website and can be accessed through the site’s contents’ page.</p>

<span id="system-requirements"></span><h1><strong>System Requirements</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#system-requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<ol class="simple">
<li><strong>The main menu should offer the following options..</strong><ol>
<li><strong>Start Game</strong><ol>
<li><em>This should bring the player to a menu where they can choose their college, whether they would like to play against a computer-controlled opponent or a human being, and an AI difficulty level (if applicable)</em></li>
<li><em>Information regarding each college’s unique attributes should be shown on this screen</em></li>
<li><em>If the player chooses to play against someone else, another area of the UI will open up to allow for the other player to select their college</em></li>
<li><em>Both players will not be able to select the same college to play as</em></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>How to Play</strong><ol>
<li><em>Brings up a flipbook-style sequence of pages that introduces the game’s story/context to players and teaches them how to play it</em></li>
<li>*This should be concise and primarily convey information graphically ***[1.8.1.1]**</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Leaderboard</strong><ol>
<li>*Displays **a list of the top 5 overall scores in the game and a simplistic name attached to each one*</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li><strong>Players should be allowed to acquire tiles for their chosen colleges as the game goes on</strong><ol>
<li><em>Only tiles that are adjacent to players’ existing acquisitions will be acquirable</em></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Tiles on the map should include:</strong><ol>

<li><em>Values unseen before acquiring</em></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>*At least three University departments and landmarks should be clearly visible ***[3]**</li>
<li><em>In accordance with <strong><em><em>1.c.iv</em></em></strong>. The tiles resources should be representative of the graphic on them. I.e. A Lake will have a fair amount of water etc.</em></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>The player will interface with the game via the use of a mouse and keyboard</strong><ol>
<li>Our game research showed that the mouse and keyboard combination is the much preferred method for playing any kind of strategy game due to the easier navigation and additional functionality <strong>[4.7.1]</strong></li>
<li>There will be keyboard shortcuts to access various menus quickly.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>A heads-up display (HUD) should display the following information whilst playing</strong><ol>
<li>Counters for current player’s resources</li>
<li>A button to access the market to, only show robot inventory in the market until auction phase <strong>[2.5]</strong></li>
<li>Button for the current user to end their turn</li>
<li>A button in the corner which leads to the pause menu (19)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Players should be able to select tiles using the control scheme described in point [5] and plant available Roboticons onto them through tool-tip menus bound to each tile</strong><ol>
<li>A tile’s tooltip will describe/present the following (provided they own it)<ol>
<li><em>The type of tile that it is; The type of resources that can be gained from it; what kind of Roboticon is working on it (if one’s working on the tile at all); options to assign or withdraw Roboticons from each tile and an option to upgrade the Roboticon working on the tile</em></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Each tile should be visually distinguishable and follow a consistent art-style</strong></li>
<li><strong>Players should be able to pause the game at any time while it ensues</strong><ol>
<li>Given that turns are timed, players should be able to attend to conversations or other tasks without it affecting the game.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>The game needs to be playable on university computers</strong><ol>
<li>It should not require a dedicated graphics accelerator other than those included with the processors powering the university’s PCs</li>
<li>It should not consume more than 4GB of RAM under any circumstances</li>
<li>The combined file-size of the game and all of its resources should be small enough to fit on the university’s servers comfortably</li>
<li>Windows 10 should be supported as these are the operating systems that the university computers run</li>
<li>It should not exceed a resolution of [1680 × 1050], as this is the resolution at which the monitors in the university’s CS department operate</li>
</ol>
</li>
