Risk Assessment & Mitigation
============================

Risk Rating
-----------

To determine the overall damage to the project that a risk may have, we
applied the likelihood and impact of the risks via a risk matrix to
abstract a ‘risk rating’, ranking them from Low, Medium, High and
Critical:

**Impact Definitions**

-  Negligible - The impact of the risk will only delay the project by a
   small number of hours

-  Minor - The impact of the risk will delay the project by 1-2 days

-  Moderate - The impact of the risk will delay the project by 3-5 days

-  Major - The impact of the risk will delay the project by 1-2 weeks

-  Severe - The impact of the risk will delay the project by 2 or more
   weeks

**Likelihood definitions**

-  Very Likely - Occurs once a week

-  Likely - Occurs once in two weeks

-  Somewhat Likely - Occurs once in three weeks

-  Unlikely - Occurs once a month

-  Very Unlikely - May occur once during the project completion time

Risk format justification
-------------------------

The risks have been formatted into a table consisting of 3 columns; Risk
name and description, Mitigation, and Overall Risk. The rows are sorted
into descending order of overall risk rating so risks that would have
the biggest impact are clearly visible and distinguishable. Risks are
ranked by evaluating negative impact to project and likelihood of
possibility. The table suggests mitigation strategies, that would help
effectively solve potential problems.
